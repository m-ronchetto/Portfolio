                    I am a senior communication design and computer science student at Washington University in St. Louis. 
                    I am passionate about making community-centered work informed by public health and urban design. 
                    Currently, I am working as a graphic designer and researcher at the Health Communication Design Studio within the Brown School of Social Work. 
                    I strive to spend my time exploring the outdoors and doing work that helps the people and the planet.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Climate change affects everyone, but BIPOC and low income communities 
                    disproportionately have to live with these risks. This poster series, made for Ben Kiel's 
                    Printing Propaganda course, provides a brief overview on some of the public health 
                    risks of our polluting behaviors while challenging the individual's perceived role in the
                    climate crisis.                    
                </p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Washington University in St. Louis is one of the top fifteen polluters in Missouri, but the
                    most pronounced effects of pollution in the region are seen ten miles off campus in East 
                    St. Louis. Prior to the pandemic, I was involved with Green Action, a student group that 
                    assists with community-driven activism in Veolia, a city in East St. Louis that bares 
                    the brunt of air pollution risks from the city's incinerator. Though my later posters in the 
                    series focus on our broader role in contributing to climate change, the first two posters 
                    are centered around resident testimonials in Veolia and the human cost of breathing 
                    unsafe air.

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    Before starting this series, I had limited experience on the letterpress, so this project
                    allowed me to further my printmaking skills, such as screenprinting, pressure prints and 
                    pronto plates. Over the course of the four poster sets, I experimented with several 
                    methods of persuasion, such as through emotions, slogans, and data visualizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike most of my work, almost none of these posters were made with any digital component- yet considering the interactions between layers and their legibility was far 	
                    more crucial in print than in Photoshop. Printmaking is a time-consuming and meticulous 
                    process, and though constructing posters is a far faster (and cleaner) process digitally, this project has encouraged me to integrate analog and digital media and to embrace the strength of a tactile poster and the imperfections of a press.
