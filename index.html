                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            St. Louis was and is a divided city, but it is also home to activists that are improving the city and country. 
                            This postcard series highlights activists from St. Louis and shares an overlooked part of the city's history.

                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            This series required me to do significant background research and talk with people who have lived in St. Louis longer than I. 
                            I was familiar with contemporary activists such as Cori Bush and Joan Lipkin, but one of the most interesting biographies I centered on,		
                            Percy Green, was someone I initially couldn't find online but rather learned about from professors familiar with his work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When looking at other design projects with similar subject matter, I was drawn to colors and image treatments that felt bold and contemporary without 
                            staying stuck in the red, white, and blue language of activism. My past design work with the Sunrise Movement was a source of inspiration as well as<a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/nyc-votes?rel=sector&rel-id=13">NYC Votes</a>led by Eddie Opara.

                        <p>
                            This was one of my earlier projects through my design education, and an introduction to making something that feels like a set without being monotonous.
                            One decision I am proud of from this project was the choice to find a typeface that fit the tone and time period of the activists, which I found from the foundry<a href="https://www.vocaltype.co/">VocalType.</a>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Climate change affects everyone, but BIPOC and low income communities 
                    disproportionately have to live with these risks. This poster series, made for Ben Kiel's 
                    Printing Propaganda course, provides a brief overview on some of the public health 
                    risks of our polluting behaviors while challenging the individual's perceived role in the
                    climate crisis.                    
                </p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Washington University in St. Louis is one of the top fifteen polluters in Missouri, but the
                    most pronounced effects of pollution in the region are seen ten miles off campus in East 
                    St. Louis. Prior to the pandemic, I was involved with Green Action, a student group that 
                    assists with community-driven activism in Veolia, a city in East St. Louis that bares 
                    the brunt of air pollution risks from the city's incinerator. Though my later posters in the 
                    series focus on our broader role in contributing to climate change, the first two posters 
                    are centered around resident testimonials in Veolia and the human cost of breathing 
                    unsafe air.

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    Before starting this series, I had limited experience on the letterpress, so this project
                    allowed me to further my printmaking skills, such as screenprinting, pressure prints and 
                    pronto plates. Over the course of the four poster sets, I experimented with several 
                    methods of persuasion, such as through emotions, slogans, and data visualizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike most of my work, almost none of these posters were made with any digital component- yet considering the interactions between layers and their legibility was far 	
                    more crucial in print than in Photoshop. Printmaking is a time-consuming and meticulous 
                    process, and though constructing posters is a far faster (and cleaner) process digitally, this project has encouraged me to integrate analog and digital media and to embrace the strength of a tactile poster and the imperfections of a press.

                        <p>
                            As conferences and concerts had to adopt to the pandemic, groups were tasked with creating virtual events that maintained the interactivity and 
                            excitement of in person events. This series of Snapchat filters, made for Amy Auman's Typography in Motion course, is an exploration of 
                            working with augmented reality and creating promotional videos.

                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although everyone in my class made promotional videos, my project was unique in that I worked with the Snapchat Lens Studio to create usable 
                            filters. My professor and peers were not familiar with the program, so I had to read into the documentation on my own. This was one of my 
                            first design projects where I discovered how much of an advantage it was to come from a background in computer science where learning new 
                            programs and skills quickly is necessary to succeed.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>
                            One thing I wish I had developed further during this project was the video encapsulating the filters. 
                            I spent most of my time developing and iterating over the filters when the original project was the promotional video. 
                            In later projects, such as the Olympic visualization and intuitive eating app, I created a concrete timeline for myself 
                            and thought holistically about the project so that I would be working on the key functionality throughout the entire project. 
                            If I did a project like this again, I would storyboard the video and work on its transitions at the same time as I was working on the filters.

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Mainstream coverage of the Olympics in the US typically covers only a few sports, and the reporters only talk about 
                    our top athletes in each one. This interactive project, made for Alvitta Ottley’s Intro to Data Visualization course, 
                    lets users view data on all Olympic sports to explore which countries have historically been the most dominant in each 
                    sport and how countries have ranked over Olympic history.
                </p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    When choosing the format of our visualization project, I was guided by the questions that motivated us to explore the Olympics, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Which countries are the most dominant (i.e. most medals) in each sport?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Which sport is each country the best at?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do countries do better than their average when they are the ones hosting the Olympics?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Who is the best individual athlete (most medals) in each sport?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I gave each of these questions a visualization, but this pulled me in conflicting directions 
                    for choosing the format of the graphs. I wanted to choose the best way to present the 
                    data while maintaining a visual system and way to navigate the visualizations so that the 
                    users would not have to learn a new way of exploring on each page.

                    This resource has helped me think more critically about why I use certain visualizations over others and encourages me to learn to program a larger variety of graphs.

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a culmination of what I learned over the semester and the chance to explore the relationship between visualizations
                     on the same screen and over several pages. It was also the largest programming project I have done as a group so far. One thing I 
                     enjoy about working on larger projects as a team is that we have the ability to divide the work to embrace our strengths. As the 
                     sole design student on the team, I took the lead in prototyping our visualizations and finding alternative designs based on user feedback. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we interviewed our peers and watched them navigate the site, I learned how valuable it is to have people who have no familiarity 
                    with the project try to explain how it works. I found that students also in the class were more hesitant to suggest large changes 
                    because they were aware of the work we had put into our project, whereas students outside the department were more inclined to 
                    suggest new visualizations and adding new datasets to our work.

                            Self care has become a multi-billion dollar industry, but self care can serve a much broader audience if it is free or low-cost. This card deck, made for Amy Auman's Design Capstone, is a set of meditations geared towards everyday life.

                        <p>
                            One motivation I had when proposing this project is the idea that this card deck could be used by anyone, not just the people who are typically encouraged to practice self care. Although this was not a traditional interactive project, I interviewed students throughout the process to get feedback on the text and image content of the cards.The patterns I generated for these cards were appealing to my interviewees because they didn't have any particular associations with self care and didn't come across as gendered.

                        <p>
                            This project was my third time doing what could be called creative coding, and as I develop my practice in this medium I am beginning to see how similar of a process this is to creating other work. One benefit of working generatively was the ability to make many iterations of the patterns, trying many colors and line densities to create a pattern that wasn't too dense or uniform, similarly to starting a project by thumbnailing many ideas.

                        <p>
                            College students are at a pivotal moment for developing their relationship with food- whether that is creating space between work and rest, choosing their own meals, or learning to enjoy food rather than see it as good or bad. This mobile prototype, made for Jonathan Hanahan's Interaction Design Capstone, is an activity book that encourages students to think mindfully about their food as they are waiting for it to be prepared.

                        <p>
                            Throughout this project, I worked in a focus group for students who were creating an app for students with access restrictions to our new dining hall (physical disabilities, allergies/dietary restrictions, eating disorders, etc). One thing I enjoyed learning during our research phase was about developing good questions and listening skills when interviewing. I observed and interviewed students in the cafe to see how the space is used and it's pain points for students and noticed that most students worked while eating and reported feeling rushed and like they could not take a break to just eat. I met with our campus dietician to discuss these pain points and common concerns students have when navigating dining services and learned that (add notes from dietician here).

                        <p>
                            One thing I enjoyed about this project was creating a space that felt separate from the ordering experience while still reminding users that the activities are done in the background of another task, waiting for food. The clock at the top of the screen is a component that is carried through every area of the app. I enjoyed working through the micro interactions of entering and exiting the activity space, both from the checkout screen and the activities menu because those points were the most critical to creating the feeling of entering a new space.

                        <p>
                            I had thought about modular typefaces before in my Tacopalooza project, but with this typeface I wanted to create something engaging out of very mundane parts. As a precursor to this assignment, our class created a series of 50 buttons with distinct interactions from each other to encourage us to consider ways to overlap animations in unexpected ways. One student's project that inspired me had buttons that deformed the other buttons and site as a whole which encouraged me to think about interactions that could deconstruct the letters of the specimen until the browser page resembles a piece of art more than a typeface.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>
                            Debugging this typeface was time consuming but was easiest for those of us who emphasized the grid and component based structure of the typeface in their jQuery as well as their design. Every letter is made of some number of five pieces- a line or polyline of various width or a rectangle in one of the primary colors. One feature I would add to this specimen if I had more time was an animation for reverting the deconstructed letters to their original form. As I learned in the parkside project, the entry and exit points in an interaction are often the most important for the user's experience.
