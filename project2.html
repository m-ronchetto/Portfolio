                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            As conferences and concerts had to adopt to the pandemic, groups were tasked with creating virtual events that maintained the interactivity and 
                            excitement of in person events. This series of Snapchat filters, made for Amy Auman's Typography in Motion course, is an exploration of 
                            working with augmented reality and creating promotional videos.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although everyone in my class made promotional videos, my project was unique in that I worked with the Snapchat Lens Studio to create usable 
                            filters. My professor and peers were not familiar with the program, so I had to read into the documentation on my own. This was one of my 
                            first design projects where I discovered how much of an advantage it was to come from a background in computer science where learning new 
                            programs and skills quickly is necessary to succeed.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>
                            One thing I wish I had developed further during this project was the video encapsulating the filters. 
                            I spent most of my time developing and iterating over the filters when the original project was the promotional video. 
                            In later projects, such as the Olympic visualization and intuitive eating app, I created a concrete timeline for myself 
                            and thought holistically about the project so that I would be working on the key functionality throughout the entire project. 
                            If I did a project like this again, I would storyboard the video and work on its transitions at the same time as I was working on the filters.
