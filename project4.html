                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            College students are at a pivotal moment for developing their relationship with food- whether that is creating space between work and rest, choosing their own meals, or learning to enjoy food rather than see it as good or bad. This mobile prototype, made for Jonathan Hanahan's Interaction Design Capstone, is an activity book that encourages students to think mindfully about their food as they are waiting for it to be prepared.

                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            Throughout this project, I worked in a focus group for students who were creating an app for students with access restrictions to our new dining hall (physical disabilities, allergies/dietary restrictions, eating disorders, etc). One thing I enjoyed learning during our research phase was about developing good questions and listening skills when interviewing. I observed and interviewed students in the cafe to see how the space is used and it's pain points for students and noticed that most students worked while eating and reported feeling rushed and like they could not take a break to just eat. I met with our campus dietician to discuss these pain points and common concerns students have when navigating dining services and learned that (add notes from dietician here).

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>
                            One thing I enjoyed about this project was creating a space that felt separate from the ordering experience while still reminding users that the activities are done in the background of another task, waiting for food. The clock at the top of the screen is a component that is carried through every area of the app. I enjoyed working through the micro interactions of entering and exiting the activity space, both from the checkout screen and the activities menu because those points were the most critical to creating the feeling of entering a new space.
